# Astra-Owain-Application
Exercise for application to Owain Evans' Astra Fellowship


### Astra Fellowship
The Astra Fellowship pairs fellows with experienced advisors to collaborate on a two or three month AI safety research project. Fellows will be part of a cohort of talented researchers working out of the Constellation offices in Berkeley, CA, allowing them to connect and exchange ideas with leading AI safety researchers. The program will take place between January 4 and March 15, 2024.


As part of my application, I'm completing this research exercise for the [Owain Evans](https://owainevans.com/) track.

The exercise is described in [Astra Research Exercises - Owain - Project Description.pdf](Astra%20Research%20Exercises%20-%20Owain%20-%20Project%20Description.pdf)

There's a report in [report/report.pdf](report/report.pdf).
